# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to build an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
A baseline CNN model will be implemented and improved through data augmentation
and model architecture changes.

## 2. Motivation
- To understand CNN-based image classification
- To observe performance changes by preprocessing and model modification
- To gain hands-on experience with an end-to-end deep learning pipeline

## 3. Dataset
- CIFAR-10
- 60,000 images (32x32 RGB)
- 10 classes

## 4. Project Plan
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Build a baseline CNN model
3. Evaluate performance and identify issues
4. Improve the model (augmentation / ResNet)
5. Analyze results and document findings

## Data Exploration
The CIFAR-10 dataset was loaded and sample images were visualized to understand
image resolution and class distribution before building the baseline model.

## Baseline Model
A simple CNN with two convolutional layers was implemented as a baseline model.
This model serves as a reference point for evaluating future improvements.
